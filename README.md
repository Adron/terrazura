## Hasura + Azure + Terraform  Next week I'm going to present a Hasura, Azure, and Terraform stream session. This is what I'm going to cover.  * Setup of infrastructure as code using Terraform. * Setup of GraphQL API Hasura Server. * Setup of Dev AND Live *Prod* Deployment using Docker &amp; Terraform. * Build out of our initial Database Schema. * Deployment of the database schema to Hasura using Hasura CLI Migrations. * Coverage of basic GraphQL and looking into introspection, queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
