# terrazura

Last week of 2020, I'm going to present a Hasura, Azure, and Terraform stream session on Twitch. This is what I'm going to cover, and it'll all go into this repository. If you'd like to watch this session, star this repo and it'll get updated at 10am PT on Wednesday the 30th. The channel I'll be streaming on, is [Thrashing Code @ Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/thrashingcode). Star this repo (*ya know, the button up in the top right, click it!), [Follow](https://www.twitch.tv/thrashingcode) my Twitch channel, and I'll see you there. ðŸ¤˜
