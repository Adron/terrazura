# terrazura

Next week I'm going to present a Hasura, Azure, and Terraform stream session. This is what I'm going to cover, and it'll all go in this repository. If you'd like to watch this session, star this repo and it'll get updated at 10am PT on Wednesday the 30th. The channel I'll be streaming on, is [Thrashing Code @ Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/thrashingcode).

* Setup of infrastructure as code using Terraform.
* Setup of GraphQL API Hasura Server.
* Setup of Dev AND Live *Prod* Deployment using Docker & Terraform.
* Build out of our initial Database Schema.
* Deployment of the database schema to Hasura using Hasura CLI Migrations.
* Coverage of basic GraphQL and looking into introspection, queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
