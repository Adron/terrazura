# terrazura

Last week of 2020 on Wednesday the 30th at 10am PT, I'm going to present a Hasura, Azure, and Terraform stream session on Twitch. The contents will go into this repository, and I'll cover the topics as bullet point listed below. If you'd like to watch this session, star this repo and it'll get updated about ~10 minutes before 10am PT on Wednesday the 30th. The channel I'll be streaming on, is [Thrashing Code @ Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/thrashingcode). Star this repo (*ya know, the button up in the top right, click it!), or [follow](https://www.twitch.tv/thrashingcode) my Twitch channel, and I'll see you there. ðŸ¤˜
