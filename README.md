# terrazura

I created this repo during a live stream on my Twitch [Thrashing Code](https://www.twitch.tv/thrashingcode) Channel ðŸ¤˜ at 10am on the 30th of December, 2020. The VOD is now available on my YouTube [Thrashing Code](https://youtube.com/thrashingcode) Channel. A rough as hell year, but wanted to wrap it up with some solid content. In this stream I tackled a ton of specifics, in detail about getting Hasura deployed in Azure, Postgres backed, a database schema designed and created, using database schema migrations, and all sorts of tips n' tricks along the way. 3 hours of solid how to get shit done material!

Some of the things covered:

* Setup of infrastructure as code using Terraform.
* Setup of GraphQL API Hasura Server.
* Setup of Dev AND Live *Prod* Deployment using Docker & Terraform.
* Build out of our initial Database Schema.
* Deployment of the database schema to Hasura using Hasura CLI Migrations.
* Coverage of basic GraphQL and looking into queries and mutations.
